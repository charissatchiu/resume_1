Hi! I'm Charissa ðŸ‘‹

I am a detail-oriented data integration specialist and analyst with 3 years of experience in drawing insight from databases and forming actionable strategies to improve operational efficiency and resolve consumer issues. I not only have a strong foundation in ETL, SQL report generation, and communicating my findings in a comprehensive manner to stakeholders at all levels. I am eager to apply my passion for problem-solving to inspire decision-making and foster collaboration and mentorship within a dynamic team.
